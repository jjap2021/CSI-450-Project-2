Using this as our project planning/pacing document so that everything is in one place.


BIG GOALS 

Interactive data displays! 

Data must be just from EIA (or other reputable resource) 

 

After 2/8 class 

Peter: I think API work? I didnâ€™t catch it 

Jack:  Organizing the Git Repo and streamlining communication, investigate API region meanings: find shape files 

Read EIA API docs for this question: what types of geographic objects are used in this data? (States, ZIPs, etc.) 

Run some small test queries and inspect results 

Maybe write some summary documentation for the group (markdown file in github?) 

What extra files do we need to be able to plot data keyed to these types of geographic objects? 

Go find shape files as needed to display our data 

Zak: finding ways to make the interaction 

Lexi:  finding ways to create the interaction using python 

Do research on how we can create interactive charts using  

Find code that shows how we can do this  

Give examples of projects that did this before 

 

Brainstorming: 

Energy production by hour 

Are there seasonal changes to energy production/consumption? 

Interaction would be comparisons across months? 

Find regional distinctions that we can use -  work more on this

 

Done: 
Git Repo - Jack
Find regional distinctions - Jack, kind of
