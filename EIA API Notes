This document will act as a 'codebook' for using the API keys. Here you'll find what to type where (eventually, my computer crashed after I did a third of this)

be sure to import 'requests' at the top of your python code so this all works, mine looks like 'wBj3RyWz9rDaJDt1m5H4O2VKYYgC5P6tWEaYgEqS'
you can also include your api key in a way like 'api_key = "XXXXXXXXXXX"', would save some tabbing back and forth

include an endpoint, i think it will mostly be 'http://api.eia.gov/v2/series/', but it's necessary to make the code work
endpoint = 'http://api.eia.gov/v2/series/'

DO NOT FORGET THE V2, THAT'S THE OLD CLIENT(i got stuck on this bug)

then you can create a request that should work pretty basically, but will be a lot of data, with the following code

params = {
    'api_key': api_key,
    'series_id': 'ELEC.GEN.ALL-AL-99.A'
}

response = requests.get(endpoint, params=params)
data = response.json()
print(data)

need the last two lines for the code to print anything. be sure to include.
